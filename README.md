## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS transfrom properties
- Flexbox
- Date Object
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Whatever you imagine is very much possible. My guiding principle, if you can't do great things, do small things in a great way. Don't be about perfection (clean codes, DRY codes, pure function), you can do it when you've completed

```html

```

```css

```

```js

```

### Continued development

This is my first react project, continue learning how to manage state using usereducer, useContext and Redux toolkit. Also, to imporve my motion design
